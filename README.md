An interactive rain radar clone running on Mapbox GL, see it live at: [https://geshem.space](https://geshem.space)

The entire service is served off of static assets located in S3 buckets:

- A static main index page, React-based JS bundle and other static assets that are uploaded upon deploy
- Radar images that are collected and indexed every minute by a Python recurring task running on AWS Lambda
